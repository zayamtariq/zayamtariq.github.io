<h1>so what IS the value in software engineering?</h1>
<b>clearly i'm missing something that the rest of the population sees. what is that?</b>

<p>this last summer i did a software engineering internship at Amazon. up until the day i got there, i honestly thought that 
    all Amazon did was the main website, and then smaller teams revolved around robotics and hardware like with Kindle and the Fire Stick. 
    i honestly didn't even know that AWS was a thing, and the only reason i was really excited to work there was because of the reputation behind it. 
    i just knew that it was one of *THE* places to be, and so i didn't really think much of it. i think this is one of my biggest issues with software engineers
    as a whole. i feel like, and i've seen this too, that <b> software engineers don't really care what role they're put in, they care more about prestige and money</b>. i know they have their preferences, 
    but give a software engineer the chance to work at google or some smaller company (with all circumstances held constant (pay, location, etc.)), and they will always choose google even if the smaller company specializes in exactly 
    what the software engineer is most passionate about. if a passion exists, that is. it's certainly not lost on me that many people are in this field 
    for security and money and all that. i think i understand that, and these aren't really the type of people i'm talking about. but there truly is no passion for this work even in 
    the young people i meet. somehow the sentiment that "it's just a job" exists, which i just can't seem to wrap my head around. here's one thing that i know to be true no matter what: 
    <b>we don't get this time back.</b> i know a lot of really, really smart people who are capable of really interesting, intriguing thoughts, and yet they just go to some random software company, which 
    really depresses me. i often wonder if maybe i'm being too childish, if maybe i need to grow up. i'm told all the time that the concept of a dream job doesn't exist. but, honestly, i agree with that! 
    i don't think dreams and jobs even really go together. but i think there are certainly interesting, meaningful problems to solve in the world, much more meaningful than developing an algorithm to trick people 
    into staying glued to their screens longer or whatever else there is. i think perhaps in the past when software was still new and fresh, the work actually was meaningful. 
    i mean, imagine how cool it would be to the guys developing the software behind google chrome! that's called having an impact. software engineers of today, at least from what i understand, 
    just don't do meaningful work. i think all the meaningful work has been taken up. is this a crazy idea?
</p>

<p> 
    a friend from a machine learning class i took once explained coding to me like this: software design itself is trivial, and rather coding should just be a tool to implement a higher purpose problem (like machine learning).
    i think now i mostly agree with this. since there is no more room for meaningful web applications, i think the only way to find meaning in your work as a software engineer is to kind of use it to do advanced mathematical functions 
    like data science and machine learning. but then, you're not a software engineer anymore. you're an AI/ML engineer.  
</p>

<p> 
    something interesting i read one time was that software engineering is the one career in which you can be a total piece of shit as a person and STILL be 
    successful, if not top of your career. all you must do is churn out the code. you honestly don't even really need to be a good communicator on a team. just do your code
    and leave. i think this is where the term "code monkey" comes from. there's a kind of mindlessness that comes with software engineering that no other field allows. 
</p>

<p>
    quite frankly i'm just really bitter, and i know that. i hate how some of the most boring people i have ever met are considered "high up" in society just because they're good at this soulless career. and even more, 
    i'm mad that i don't fit the mold for that. i wish i could be respected in society. but i don't like meaningless work like coding, so i guess i'm fucked. 
</p> 

<h2>ok now what is meaningful about this stupid ass career?</h2>

<p> 
    i've learned that, apparently, generalizing people is a bad, shortsighted thing to do. so i'm going to assume that actually cool people do software engineering too and that they see the value in it in a way that i can't. 
    so i will be trying to get into the mind of a software engineer that ISN'T a surface-level loser, and try and explain why someone should study software engineering. here we go: 
</p>

<ul> 
    <li>helps you manage other software engineers better (if you want to start a company). this doesn't really motivate me but i see how it can motivate others.</li>
    <li>i think learning how to design big systems in the back-end probably teaches you some universal truths about how to plan for large-scale problems efficiently.</li>
    <li>solving problems in the computer engineering space is akin to building up small pieces of knowledge into one big solution, akin to building things with legos.</li>
    <li>building things is just satisfying, i guess. read: <a href="/madness_of_engineering.html">the madness of engineering</a> </li> 
    <li>maybe we shouldn't worry too much about the meaning of our work. maybe work just is work. (this is bullshit but you can believe it if you want)</li>
    
</ul>

<p>i think perhaps viewing software engineering as a metaphor for life is the best way to approach it. there's nothing inherently useful about learning 
    something as arbitrary as a web dev framework, but perhaps learning how to design a website can teach you how to break apart problems and solve them 
    efficiently.
