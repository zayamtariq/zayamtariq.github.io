<h1>this is my website. my name is zayam.</h1>
<p>i'm not that good at web dev stuff but i hope if i keep trying that i end up with something really cool.</p>
<p>i kind of want to use this as a way of just compiling every cool or interesting thing about the universe that i learn into one place.</p>
<p>sometimes i worry that the internet isn't "real", and so my work here won't last.</p> 
<p>i think thats a valid fear. it certainly isnt as real as compiling everything on pencil and paper </p>
<p>i've decided to push through this fear though. i think the internet has given us a really unique opportunity to put ourselves out there and share who we are with the world. its probably foolish not to take advantage of that. </p>  

<h2>a long time ago i had this idea of compiling every single thought/story/whatever in my mind and kind of mapping them out explicitly like a linked list, to understand myself better</h2>
<p>although <a href="/array_is_king.html">they're practically pretty useless</a>, i think linked list might be my favorite data structure. i think they map out ideas (data) similarly to how the human brain probably does.</p>
<p>looking back on this now after taking algorithms, i realize that i'm talking about undirected graphs and NOT linked lists. its funny so i'll keep it.</p>

<div class="circle"> this is like a linked list node </div>
<p> perhaps one day ill get good enough at web dev to connect it to other nodes </p>

<br> 

<h3>BUT FOR NOW</h3>
<p>i'll just kinda make a bullet point list of everything. if this list gets big enough the graph might never happen. 
    again, this is a sacrifice i'm willing to make.
