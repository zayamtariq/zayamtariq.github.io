<h1>this is my website. my name is zayam.</h1>
<p>i'm not that good at web dev stuff but i hope if i keep trying that i end up with something really cool.</p>
<h2>i don't expect any of what i write here to be coherent to anyone but myself. this is ok with me for now.</h2>
<p>i kind of want to use this as a way of just compiling every cool or interesting thing about the universe that i learn into one place.</p>
<p>sometimes i worry that the internet isn't "real", and so my work here won't last.</p> 
<p>i think thats a valid fear. it certainly isnt as real as compiling everything on pencil and paper </p>
<p>i've decided to push through this fear though. i think the internet has given us a really unique opportunity to put ourselves out there and share who we are with the world. its probably foolish not to take advantage of that. </p>
