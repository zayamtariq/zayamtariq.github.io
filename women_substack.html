<p>publishing things online, for the first time in many people's lives, gives them the chance to believe that their voice actually matters. how often do you speak to 200,000 people at a time in real life, and how often does a tweet go viral to 
    200,000 likes? it's night and day. so when you see it through this lens, it's almost impossible to believe that people can feel lonely or like they don't matter. when you zoom out, though, it becomes really obvious why.
