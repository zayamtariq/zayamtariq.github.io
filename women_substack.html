<u>some notes/summary:</u>
<ul> 
    <li>women's problems are hyper-romanticized in media in a thousand different ways. seems like the entire female experience has been explicitly charted out spanning all kinds of media.</li>
    <li>we kind of have these widespread trivializations of women's issues (i.e. how a lot of attention seeking women have daddy issues, even if they're not really being that attention seeking. let alone the fact that there are multiple causes for a singular issue for literally half the population. i suppose this is the nature of stereotypes)</li>
    <li>"i am making sure to eat a square of dark chocolate during my depressive episodes so they’ll sound sexy in my memoirs"</li>
    <p>i can actually also kind of resonate to always creating for an audience in mind. sometimes its a blessing because it keeps my writing from being totally derailed, but also sometimes i just want to make something for ME. i want to live for ME.</p> 
    <li>filtering personal experiences through the eyes of a consumer. being caught up more in what people think of us than what we think of ourselves.</li>
    <li>"we rationalize our own suffering through the romanticization of those who have suffered before us and, in turn, we provide a blueprint for the hot-girl suffering of those after"</li>
    <li>the author feels, that even if she acknowledges these phenomena of being described through media tropes and being romanticized through hell and back, she still can't help but be attracted to it all. it gives her a place to define herself. gives her a place to belong.</li>
</ul>

<b>"we consume so much, now, that perhaps we don’t know what it means to exist as something unsellable. i had to give up journalling because i couldn’t stop writing for the people who would read it after i was dead."</b>

<p>this is really fascinating to me because now i'm starting to realize, more and more, that maybe i view myself as a product at all times. why else do i comb my hair in the morning and brush my teeth and shower every morning? sure there is an element of wanting to feel nice about myself, 
    but it's rooted entirely in the gaze of others (not to make this about me, a man, since this problem seems to be predominantly woman-based, male-gaze and all. but i relate to this in part too!). 
</p>

<p>i think a lot about my little sister and so i guess i'm going to try and frame this through her point of view. or, more specifically, my point of view of what her worldview is, and how it's 
    come to be like that. i'll come back to this later. 
</p>

<p>publishing things online, for the first time in many people's lives, gives them the chance to believe that their voice actually matters. how often do you speak to 200,000 people at a time in real life, and how often does a tweet go viral to 
    200,000 likes? it's night and day. so when you see it through this lens, it's almost impossible to believe that people can feel lonely or like they don't matter. when you zoom out, though, it becomes really obvious why.
