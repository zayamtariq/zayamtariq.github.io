<u>some notes/summary:</u>
<ul> 
    <li>women's problems are hyper-romanticized in media in a thousand different ways. seems like the entire female experience has been explicitly charted out spanning all kinds of media.</li>
    <li>we kind of have these widespread trivializations of women's issues (i.e. how a lot of attention seeking women have daddy issues, even if they're not really being that attention seeking. let alone the fact that there are multiple causes for a singular issue for literally half the population. i suppose this is the nature of stereotypes)</li>
    <li>"i am making sure to eat a square of dark chocolate during my depressive episodes so they’ll sound sexy in my memoirs"</li>
    <p>i can actually also kind of resonate to always creating for an audience in mind. sometimes its a blessing because it keeps my writing from being totally derailed, but also sometimes i just want to make something for ME. i want to live for ME.</p> 
    <li>filtering personal experiences through the eyes of a consumer. being caught up more in what people think of us than what we think of ourselves.</li>
    <li>"we rationalize our own suffering through the romanticization of those who have suffered before us and, in turn, we provide a blueprint for the hot-girl suffering of those after"</li>
    <li>the author feels, that even if she acknowledges these phenomena of being described through media tropes and being romanticized through hell and back, she still can't help but be attracted to it all. it gives her a place to define herself. gives her a place to belong.</li>

<b>"we consume so much, now, that perhaps we don’t know what it means to exist as something unsellable. i had to give up journalling because i couldn’t stop writing for the people who would read it after i was dead."</b>

<p>this is really fascinating to me because now i'm starting to realize, more and more, that maybe i view myself as a product at all times. why else do i comb my hair in the morning and brush my teeth and shower every morning? sure there is an element of wanting to feel nice about myself, 
    but it's rooted entirely in the gaze of others (not to make this about me, a man, since this problem seems to be predominantly woman-based, male-gaze and all. but i relate to this in part too!). 
</p>

<p>i think a lot about my little sister and so i guess i'm going to try and frame this through her point of view. or, more specifically, my point of view of what her worldview is, and how it's 
    come to be like that. i'll come back to this later. 
    <br> 
    <br> 
    i remember one time when my sister was in second grade, she got this big zit on her face, which made her really, really devastated. she started crying, firmly saying that she didn't want to go to school that day. eventually, we did convince her to go to school, 
    but only once she got ahold of a napkin to put over her face, which she apparently did for the whole school day. my little sister has kind of always been really self conscious about the way she looks. i suspect that this comes from a (relatively short) lifetime of constantly being praised about how
    good looking you are. one might believe that this is a good thing. in fact, some might not even consider it a problem. but here's the damage with telling young girls that they're beautiful: that's where they begin to believe that their value comes from. i read this fantastic poem about this 
    topic earlier this year that goes like this: 
    <br><br> 
    <b>when your little girl <br>
        asks you if she’s pretty <br>
        your heart will drop like a wineglass<br>
        on the hardwood floor<br>
        part of you will want to say<br>
        of course you are, don’t ever question it<br>
        and the other part<br>
        the part that is clawing at<br>
        you<br>
        will want to grab her by her shoulders<br>
        look straight into the wells of<br>
        her eyes until they echo back to you<br>
        and say<br>
        you do not have to be if you don’t want to<br>
        it is not your job<br>
        both will feel right<br>
        one will feel better<br>
        she will only understand the first<br>
        when she wants to cut her hair off<br>
        or wear her brother’s clothes<br>
        you will feel the words in your<br>
        mouth like marbles<br>
        you do not have to be pretty if you don’t want to<br>
        it is not your job</b> 
    <br>

    this poem breaks my heart in all the right ways, and kind of gives me a compass of how i want to value the people in my life in the future. i think complimenting people on anything that isn't their control, much like valuing anything out of our own control, 
    is meaningless. it doesn't actually mean anything. you're essentially complimenting the universe on the probabilistic nature of itself. i'd rather tell someone that i love their outfit more than i'd like to tell them how good looking they are. better yet, compliment 
    the ideas and thoughts in their mind! those are something that everyone has to work on organically, at least if they're not totally surface level. although now that i think about it, i suppose that a lot of people do try to form opinions based on 
    pre-conceived narratives and just what the popular opinion is. i think its within our nature. but even so, complimenting people on the beautiful thoughts in their mind, if they really are beautiful, is a good way of living life i think.

<p>publishing things online, for the first time in many people's lives, gives them the chance to believe that their voice actually matters. how often do you speak to 200,000 people at a time in real life, and how often does a tweet go viral to 
    200,000 likes? it's night and day. so when you see it through this lens, it's almost impossible to believe that people can feel lonely or like they don't matter. when you zoom out, though, it becomes really obvious why.
