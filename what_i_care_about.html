<h1>what do i care about?</h1>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H7fhqgFd6o&ab_channel=visa">this interview between two of my biggest heroes has recently shaped a lot of the way i see life recently</a>

<p> 
    a part that really resonated with me here was the idea that there are two paths (let's pretend in isolation): 
    <ol>
        <li>people who choose a path with more money</li>
        <li>people who choose a path that entails a more interesting life</li>
    </ol> 
    and the basic idea is that people who choose path 1, when asked what they care about, often don't know how to respond. this is because that money is not a real thing to care about. 
    i.e. once you have it, it's not something that you want to actually continue pursuing. think of it like maslow's hierarchy of needs:

    the final step, self-actualization, is i think where most people who choose path 1 believe the whole "making money" part goes. the thing about self-actualization is that it's a feeling that should never go away. 
    for me, writing is going to be a never-ending journey until the day i die. it's honestly not even a choice; i can feel my mind start to turn to mush when i haven't written in a long time. i can't imagine not doing this. 
    i guess i just like the sound of my voice. from what i understand about money, it's not like that. once you have enough to be comfortable (let's say, 80k a year? i'm terribly out of touch with money, i'm sure this is still upper middle class.),
    you don't necessarily want to chase more. it's a flawed kind of self-actualization. once you have the money to be secure, you're kind of done, aren't you? what now? i guess since the story is done we should just kill ourselves right? 
    and i mean that sincerely, for people who's whole dream it is to make money: what happens once you get it? your story is done. it's either time to realize that life can just be fun and interesting and not about money, or 
    with all due respect, kill yourself. do you see what i'm getting at here? obviously it sounds ridiculous to kill yourself. i think we all know what needs to be done here.

<h3>so now the question is: what do I care about, then?</h3>

<p>this question makes me feel a lot of shame for some reason. i don't know where that comes from. </p>
<b>here's what i believe i care about. whether i actually do or if i'm just feeding myself the narrative that i do care about this stuff is up in the air and is left as an exercise to the reader.</b>
<ol> 
    <li>the pursuit of ideas, to better understand myself</li>
    <li>to hopefully understand myself so well that i can help other weird people like me understand themselves</li>
    <li>writing. the community of writers, the community of ideas, the process of writing. all of it is quite cool.</li>
    <li>i really care about understanding how to optimize problems perfectly, and understanding how that optimization occurs</li>
    <li>i care about people! is that too easy? i just really care about people, although i wish i could connect with them better</li>
    <li>can fears count as cares? i really fear being boring and generic and surface level. i think this is one of my biggest motivators. i suppose
        i care above all else to be interesting in a way that impacts people in a positive way. that would be the dream. i think i'm still a long ways away from that.
