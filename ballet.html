<b>"Ballet, like certain other disciplines such as gymnastics or figure skating, can feel like an intensive activity bound to the realm of childhood."</b>
<p>this resonates so much with me! i often feel like many of the most interesting hobbies now are, ultimately, useless since you can't ever be at the top. this is like a sunk-cost fallacy type thing at play. 
    and also something that i assume has to do with capitalism forcing us to believe that we must be the best in order to be "worthy". there's a lot of shame joining a recreational sport as an adult almost, because what's the point? 
    the point is that if you really love something, you don't care how good at it you are. you just do it. the author touches on this too.

<b>"But this was a group of middle-aged women, many of whom attended class multiple times a week, who would stay after class to perfect their moves, who advocated for their own education and sought out performance opportunities. Some of them had been coming to classes for years. Here was the point staring me right in the face â€” it didn't matter; they just loved to dance."</b>

<p>funnily enough, even in childhood, whenever we do something we only do it because we like it. being good at something, worrying about how useful something is in the future, these are adult fears. it's really important to ask: 
    is it such a crime to want to casually enjoy our lives instead of being good at everything we do? and the answer is, of course, no!

    this article gives me a lot of hope in one specific regard: that my life won't be over after college. i think about that a lot. college is kind of the last time 
    that our lives are organized around other people the same age as us. and although it seems like common sense, there are groups of people who want to gather to do cool things that they love after college too. 
    there will be ping pong clubs and dance clubs and book clubs all over the world wherever you go. as long as humans crave community - as long as humans stay humans - their will always be groups to join, at least if you
    have the courage to get out of your shell and join them.

    it's also interesting how things like games can bring people together and kind of provide that sense of belonging. i think back to the ping pong club that i go to, and i think most of the time
    that these people would probably be in different crowds than me in high school. but, we all love this game ping pong. and so we play. and we don't have to talk if we don't want to, just play. and slowly but surely, 
    we DO talk, because humans are social creatures, and it doesn't matter what background we come from anymore because all you have to do is shut up and play this intricate dance of ping pong with me. 

    AND PING PONG IS A DANCE. it has rythm and tempo, and you have to kind of have a lot of faith in the person across the table to hit the ball back and be a worthy opponent. its a really intimate game i think. 
    the ball is the song or something? i don't know, go watch ping pong the animation if you want a better artistic metaphor of the game.
