<h1>framing life through constraints</h1>

<p>constraints are awesome because they give us something to innovate towards. for example, have you ever heard a story from a small kid and it is just totally all over the place? 
    like, somehow a dinosaur shows up out of nowhere from the ground and starts eating a witch that also came out of nowhere and somehow wait there actually wasn't a dinosaur it was actually a giant chicken? 
    this is a bad story, and i think it can kinda be chalked up to how well the constraints of storytelling are understood. children, for better or for worse, disregard rules and constraints, and thus don't really innovate or 
    push the envelope. this is natural, since kids are generally stupider than adults. when you respect the constraints, then you can understand how to break through them in a meaningful way. i think this is the true nature 
    of innovation. one thing i'm unsure about, though, is whether innovation can be optimized towards. from what i can understand, most innovative results are typically created by some erratic luck.

<h2>how can innovation be optimized towards?</h2>
<p>i think everyone can basically agree that success does include some luck, but even luck can become negligible with the right amount of persistence. so then, innovation should be able 
    to be optimized towards right?
