<h1>framing life through constraints</h1>

<p>constraints are awesome because they give us something to innovate towards. for example, have you ever heard a story from a small kid and it is just totally all over the place? 
    like, somehow a dinosaur shows up out of nowhere from the ground and starts eating a witch that also came out of nowhere and somehow wait there actually wasn't a dinosaur it was actually a giant chicken? 
    this is a bad story, and i think it can kinda be chalked up to how well the constraints of storytelling are understood. children, for better or for worse, disregard rules and constraints, and thus don't really innovate or 
    push the envelope. this is natural, since kids are generally stupider than adults. when you respect the constraints, then you can understand how to break through them in a meaningful way. i think this is the true nature 
    of innovation. one thing i'm unsure about, though, is whether innovation can be optimized towards. from what i can understand, most innovative results are typically created by some erratic luck.

<h2>how can innovation be optimized towards?</h2>
<p>i think everyone can basically agree that success does include some luck, but even luck can become negligible with the right amount of persistence. so then, innovation should be able 
    to be optimized towards right?

    i had this idea one time that the more constraints you were given, the more impressive it is when you create something awesome. think about it: what if you found out the mona lisa was actually made with only a single pencil, and the color was actually from the blood of the artist in various shades rather than paint. that's an impressive constraint! 
    life is kind of like art. we are given a set of constraints, and we maximize that life given those constraints. if i earned 100 dollars in my entire life given MY life circumstances, well that's not that impressive. in fact, no one would even care. but if you look at a guy from some far-off tribe in the middle of a desert, and he is on 
    this magnificent quest to earn 100 dollars, now THAT is a story that somehow we can all relate to. that is kind of crazy, right? our constraints, our limitations, do define us in a way. but i dont think that needs to be demoralizing or anything. it just helps us stay self-aware of our position in life and we're self-actualizing in a proper, meaningful way.

    i've been thinking about self-actualization a lot, actually. i like the word, but more than that i wonder if I'M self-actualizing in the way that i want to be self-actualizing. am i doing the things i want to be doing? do i really know what i care about? 
    i don't think so, but a common sentiment i hear is that NO ONE really knows what they care about.
