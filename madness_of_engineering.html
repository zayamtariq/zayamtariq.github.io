<h1>a lot of the times in engineering school, i struggle to find meaning in the work that i do.</h1>

<p> i remember john green called it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgDGlcxYrhQ&ab_channel=TED">the act of jumping through arbitrary hoops</a>.That continues to speak to me all the time whenever 
i find myself in class. often the cool shit that i want to make feels like it's at odds with what teachers feel is best for learning
or whatever. and i get that. i trust my teachers to know what's best. but also, sometimes it can feel restricting. if i suddenly 
decide that i find website development really interesting halfway through the semester, but i'm in a circuits class, naturally i 
can't just jump to web development and leave circuits behind. i suppose i'm just bad at discipline, but maybe learning should be a messy 
act that we find ourselves just jumping around random topics with. and thinking back, i wonder if this is why i never felt so 
lost in high-school, as i was forced to kind of study every topic with the same level of intensity. </p> 

<h2>I wonder how I can just always channel my inner engineer?</h2>

<p>i can very clearly see and understand that there is this big love and desire to create within me. maybe i was just feeling 
    burnt out. i guess a better question is <b>what makes me HATE engineering?</b> And that answer is simple. When i feel like i dont
    have enough time to explore the shit im genuinely interested in on the side. this is a basic tenet of burnout i feel. watching for it 
    and being conscious of it and understanding that im not just a work machine would probably be really beneficial for me in the long run. 
    the feeling is nice though. the madness of engineering. you feel this big swell of happiness permeate within you, which is a kind of beautiful thing. 
    the most exhilirating part is how... independent it is, if that makes sense. like the great thing about independent projects is that no one told 
    me to do this. i followed my personal interest in doing something, and since i'm usually so averse to doing ANYTHING (even the things i really, really want), 
    this feels like a step in the right direction. 
</p>

eventually i need to format everything really nice. but i'm just going to enjoy the broke look of this website for a little bit. 
gives it a young feeling. 

also just found out that apparently if you don't put any "left facing carrot" type symbols around your sentences, it acts like a p thingy.

<!-- THIS IS HOW COMMENTS WORK OH MY GOD I HATE THIS. but ok also i want to make this page a node eventually.
how will these nodes be designed anyways? will each node just be a big main idea, or is each node its own web page?
i suppose we can have these sort-of "spheres of influence" that exist around each web page, and see how closely related each 
essay really is. -->
