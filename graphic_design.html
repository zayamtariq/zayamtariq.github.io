<h1>my mom studied graphic design when i was a kid... why?</h1> 

<p>
    when i was a kid i remember my mom was a stay-at-home mom, but i never found that weird. up until that point of my life 
    i didn't even know women were allowed to do work, i thought it was just something that dads did. so when i found out my mom was gonna be going to university to then LATER get a job
    i thought that was really, really strange: i also didn't know grown adults went to school. but she did go. and i eventually found out that she was studying "graphic design", or computer art. 
    i'm not here to discount graphic design as a field like how i hate software engineering. my distate towards software engineering is rooted in a lot of my own insecure hatred for the people who do it, and the soullessness of the 
    subject itself. interestingly enough, <b>graphic design might be the perfect antithesis to software engineering</b>. think about it like this: 
    graphic design doesn't have to feign creativity. it IS creativity. it is perhaps the most pure type of art that can exist on a computer, farthest removed from the entire software engineering industry. 
</p> 

<h2>unrelated tangent: complaining about things isn't interesting, and it doesn't make me cool.</h2>
<p>i desperately need to get over this hatred of software engineering, and yet i feel it within the deepest pits of my soul. it is a hatred that can not be removed, it is a hatred that i feel defines me almost. and yet, 
    when i think of the most interesting, attractive people of my life: none of them ever complain. in fact, they are rarely even negative. and despite being seductively in reach, and apparently also healthy to some extent, complaining about life 
    without wanting to take any real action is perhaps the most annoying thing i can be doing right now. either i have to figure out how to save these people from software engineering, or i keep my mouth shut and let people do their thing 
    since it's literally not affecting me. i'm not sure why i can't let other people just exist living their boring lives. i'm not sure where this desire to tell people that they're living their lives wrong comes from. 
    that's almost bordering on a god complex, which is kind of concerning. but also i feel like i'm trying to come from a good place. like, come on, let's do something interesting with this one, puny, insignificant life that we get! fuck the web apps man! 
    this is something i feel far too strongly about. i don't know what to do about this.

<h1>why someone should study graphic design</h1>
<p>i remember a couple years after my mom graduated, and after i had grown up a little more too, i started dabbling in digital art. 
    i wasn't anything good, but i remember it felt very freeing in a way that pencil and paper didn't. all the tools that they provided made the boring parts of art fast, while still rewarding the parts that i felt were valuable. finally, 
    i was able to create the scenes in my head much closer than when i was on pencil and paper. and this discussion kind of reminds me of what people are talking about 
    right now with the whole AI thing. AI, much like computers before, are simply tools that the human use to better realize their own work. but the human is still ultimately 
    the most important part, even if the path there is simplified. the parts of a product that humans value are inherently still human, and no robot or tool can shortcut us to that point.

    some basic conclusions i can derive for why someone should/would study graphic design: 
    <ul>
        <li>i guess, like with any college degree, you learn the art of problem solving (this is very broad though)</li>
        <li>creating art gives you this focus on the thing that you are drawing that you would otherwise take for granted.
            it helps you appreciate all the curves and edges and fine details of what you are drawing. 
        </li> 
        <li>attempting to understand the customer you're advertising for is a fantastic exercise in empathy (graphic design 
            is a fundamentally human career. i suppose most careers are.) 
        </li>
        <li>
            i think most people have really, really great ideas. there are a lot of beautiful minds out there. but perhaps the outlets for expression are too hard (drawing is very tough). 
            graphic design and digital art are kind of the great equalizers, and gives everyone the chance to share the amazing thoughts in their brains
        </li> 
    </ul>

    i think i might ask my mom why she was so interested in graphic design too.
