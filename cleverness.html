<h1>ON CLEVERNESS</h1>

     <dt>cleverness has become a nuisance</dt>
     <dd>- i'm trying to think about this in my life. cleverness only feels like a nuisance when it's being used against me, though 
        i suppose that now when i think about it, all desire in my life to feel clever by myself has come from wanting to feel superior to others. 
        that's a nasty feeling. i think i should stop doing that. 
     </dd>
     <dt>cleverness can be contrasted with genuine wisdom</dt>
     <dd> 
        - this is interesting to me because i thought they were the same. seems like this article defines cleverness 
        as something akin to snappy one-liner tweets in the form of "clap-backs". i can actually agree that i hate this. 
     </dd>
     <dt> cleverness can also be associated with insight though </dt>

<h1> how do we define cleverness? </h1>
<p> it meets two criteria: </p>
<br> 
<p>1. smart/insightful in a way the AVERAGE PERSON MIGHT MISS (imagination/command of situation that other people wouldn't be capable of)</p> 
<br> 
<p>2. witty, which again means command and control </p>
<h2> UNRELATED TANGENT: being successful in life seems to somehow relate to control</h2>
<br> 
<p> and, like, i mean in all aspects. control means like waking up early and having the discipline to sleep early and also to sleep 8 hours a day and also to eat 3 meals a day and also go to the gym and also be social because FOR SOME REASON being social is really hard? even though we're social creatures? how did we evolve like this? </p>
<br> 
<p>"There is a detached, isolated composure with which the clever individual can survey the whole scene and make connections others can’t"</p>
<p>this ^^^ is an idea that keeps appearing more and more in my life. that those who perform the best take this "detached interest" in the work/problem at hand. this visceral understanding that the best work, to be in the zone, is done when calm. think about ultra instinct (as silly as it is). goku fights his best when he STOPS thinking and lets his body do what it wants without the judgement of his inner critic. i think there are parallels to real life here! being clever is something we are all capable of. i don't want to simplify, but i think the thing stopping us from making really awesome breakthroughs is this feeling of being "stalked by time": either believing we don't have the time to solve a problem, or feeling the pressure from some sort of external factor that can be reduced down to time (i.e. i have to solve this problem in a set amount of time or else the external factor will do X to me). to be clever and to be in command and to be in control are all the same thing and require you to have an objective inner critic. </p> 
<b>"In the airport, people are removed from any context in which they might have real social connections or any purpose at all, aside from waiting. They are held captive in an antiseptic, controlled environment with no escape and nothing to do but consume and gawk.

    The airport is one of a number of modern spaces—the shopping mall, the stadium, the waiting room, the amusement park—that reduce the individual to a minimum of subjectivity, or at the very least strive to make that subjectivity irrelevant. As a passenger, a shopper, a “guest,” you are not quite yourself, but become something like the faceless figures in architects’ three-dimensional renderings of these spaces."</b>
<p>i love the way this is put. participating in anything automatically puts you under this arbitrary label that, based on social conventions, limits WHO YOU CAN BE. that is freaky in a really awesome way.</p>
<p>ITS FORCED PASSIVITY. in these spaces, you can not act out or differentiate yourself in any way that would be meaningful at all.</p>
<p>and now that i really think about it. you can say this about ANY space, can't we? as long as i'm being labelled by my environment on what is and what isn't conventional, i'm always going to be pre-defined. is this true? is this ok? i'll think about this more.</p>
<b>"Twitter’s quote tweet function, especially, enables users literally as well as metaphorically to appear above the conversation and to cleverly one-up their opponents from this privileged position. The game, in effect, is this: Who can appear the most above it all? But the circumstances of posting—alone at the controls with no one around but everyone watching—all but guarantee that posts are alloyed with insecurity, however clever they might be" !!! </b> 
<p>being clever is truly based on an insecurity of seeming stupid. the only reason we feel satisfaction for dunking on others is because we need to validate OURSELVES. woah. this is an interesting frame to see things from.</p>
<p>being clever might also be rooted in wanting the world to make sense, and being frustrated that it doesn't. so perhaps the natural reaction is to just say: "look how above this whole thing i am", despite being really scared. the truely awesome reaction is to say: "i have no idea what is going on, but let me try my best to move in any direction despite NONE OF THIS LIFE STUFF MAKING SENSE!"</p>
