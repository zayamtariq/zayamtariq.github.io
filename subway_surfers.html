<h1>what is the fucking deal with subway surfers?</h1>

<p>everywhere i go that has video media (instagram reels, youtube shorts, tiktok), there seems to be this medium of content 
    of someone talking over themselves playing a game. it will be in this split-screen format, with the person speaking on the top of the screen, 
    and the game being played on the bottom. let me get a picture of this:

<p>i hope this helps visualize things. while writing this im realizing that it's really hard to explain the internet to someone who doesn't use it. 
    i think i'll write the rest of this by assuming that people know what the internet, askreddit, and everything is. this is a dangerous way to live, and quite frankly, not an 
    admirable one. to live my life assuming that everyone has the same shared experience as me is a flawed one. in fact, the majority of people that are alive right now don't have ANY of the same 
    shared experiences as me.

    ok anyways. this type of content seems to be really popular nowadays, increasingly more i noticed with the advent of the tik-tok style of media. and i'll call it the tik-tok style of media rather than describing what it actually is 
    (short videos recorded exclusively in vertical format, for the sole intent of quick viewing and then moving on to the next short video recorded exclusively in vertical format, for the sole intent of...), because i think we all know what 
    style of video i'm talking about. it's taken over the entire internet in a really interesting way. i don't have any verifiable evidence, but it feels like life as a whole, since tiktok, has kind of revolved around quick shortcuts. i don't think many people

    i don't think the majority of people in my engineering friend groups has even touched a book in the last 3 years, save for some outliers. we just watch youtube or tiktok. so, like, you hear about attention spans going down. shortcuts are natural and probably 
    tie back to some evolution shit for how we want the shortest path. sometimes, the shortest path doesn't even mean lazy. ask djikstra, he'll just tell you that it's optimal. 
    with all this empirical, poorly researched evidence that i've collected here before you, i'm certainly starting to believe that the whole attention span thing is true. and although i don't know the real science of the brain or anything like that, i feel it within myself too. 
    i felt my focus dwindle more and more when i was on social media, and i don't think that's a placebo since it seems to be a widely held thought.

<p>
    so what does this have to do with subway surfers? the whole attention span thing seems to be going from bad to worse. now, instead of one tiktok video at a time, we're running two in parallel? something just isn't right here.

<b>note to self: make formatting more interesting. i think rly learning css could be a valuable use of time. also need to expand on this whole attention span thing whenever i feel like coming back to this.</b>
