<h1>what is the fucking deal with subway surfers?</h1>

<p>everywhere i go that has video media (instagram reels, youtube shorts, tiktok), there seems to be this medium of content 
    of someone talking over themselves playing a game. it will be in this split-screen format, with the person speaking on the top of the screen, 
    and the game being played on the bottom. let me get a picture of this: 
</p>

<p>i hope this helps visualize things. while writing this im realizing that it's really hard to explain the internet to someone who doesn't use it. 
    i think i'll write the rest of this by assuming that people know what the internet, askreddit, and everything is. this is a dangerous way to live, and quite frankly, not an 
    admirable one. to live my life assuming that everyone has the same shared experience as me is a flawed one. in fact, the majority of people that are alive right now don't have ANY of the same 
    shared experiences as me. 
</p>
<p> 
    ok anyways. this type of content seems to be really popular nowadays, increasingly more i noticed with the advent of the tik-tok style of media. and i'll call it the tik-tok style of media rather than describing what it actually is 
    (short videos recorded exclusively in vertical format, for the sole intent of quick viewing and then moving on to the next short video recorded exclusively in vertical format, for the sole intent of...), because i think we all know what 
    style of video i'm talking about. it's taken over the entire internet in a really interesting way. i don't have any verifiable evidence, but it feels like life as a whole, since tiktok, has kind of revolved around quick shortcuts. i don't think many people 
    <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/05/05/covid-isnt-why-americans-arent-going-to-the-movies-study-suggests/?sh=709ad67d5180">go to the movie theaters anymore</a>, we just watch tiktok or youtube. 
    i don't think the majority of people in my engineering friend groups has even touched a book in the last 3 years, save for some outliers. we just watch youtube or tiktok. so, like, you hear about attention spans going down. shortcuts are natural and probably 
    tie back to some evolution shit for how we want the shortest path. sometimes, the shortest path doesn't even mean lazy. ask djikstra, he'll just tell you that it's optimal. 
    with all this empirical, poorly researched evidence that i've collected here before you, i'm certainly starting to believe that the whole attention span thing is true. and although i don't know the real science of the brain or anything like that, i feel it within myself too. 
    i felt my focus dwindle more and more when i was on social media, and i don't think that's a placebo since it seems to be a widely held thought. 
</p>
<p>
    so what does this have to do with subway surfers? the whole attention span thing seems to be going from bad to worse. now, instead of one tiktok video at a time, we're running two in parallel? something just isn't right here. 
</p>

<p> 
    there are tells when people aren't listening. sometimes people will just go on their phone mid-conversation with you, which is really weird. people don't really feel like people anymore. or perhaps i'm the one 
    who's been dehumanized. is it my fault that i'm not addicted to tiktok? the weirdest part is that we all kind of collectively know that a time-sink occurs, that we're wasting hours and hours on this app, and then... that's it. 
    no one wants to do anything about it. people just like having talking points for the sake of being interesting, for the sake of seeming like they're above the technology that they're enslaved to. why is action so hard for everyone? 
    i've noticed i do this in my writing, where i'll often end essays with questions and then not answering them, just because of laziness. i convince myself at the time that the question sounds better open-ended. 
</p>

<p> 
    ATTENTION SPAN IS THE LOWEST ITS EVER BEEN! and for some reason i feel like i can say that with full confidence despite not being a brain doctor. its funny how i can be so certain of something i have no more knowledge of than a 5 year old. 
    i'm bullshitting, and i don't think i'm in the minority of people who do this. people are bullshitting all the time and this is just a way of life i suppose. 
    ok but let's pretend that i'm a brain doctor and that i CAN say that attention span is the lowest it's ever been. now what? what does anyone do with this information? that means, 
    if you can somehow drown out the noise of the world (social media, youtube, subway surfers ask reddit shits), then you're automatically in the top percent of society. i've been thinking about that a lot 
    too: 
</p>

<h2>it's really, really easy to be in the top percent of people in society</h2>
<ul> 
    <li>lots of people want to be artists, but how many people are ACTUALLY creating?</li>
    <li>so many engineers i know don't even SERIOUSLY try to work on something interesting. this means that actually being interested in engineering (finding problems that interest you and then doing that), automatically puts you at the top. passion will always overtake anything else. conviction for money isn't a real thing.</li>
    <li>lots of people want to be youtubers, but how many people at the start get discouraged because no one is watching?</li>
    <li>you can kind of tell that people want to be successful more than they actually want to do the thing. so when, at the beginning, if people aren't successful (which they wont be), they'll quit! because they didn't actually like the thing! they just liked the idea of being good!</li>
    <li>literally just doing what you enjoy with really serious conviction will automatically put you at the top (if youre lucky enough to have the time to do this)</li>
</ul>
<p>this is all assuming that your other needs are sufficiently met ^. if you're anywhere other than on the self-actualization stage on maslows, its probably better to tend to those things first.</p> 

<b>note to self: make formatting more interesting. i think rly learning css could be a valuable use of time. also need to expand on this whole attention span thing whenever i feel like coming back to this.</b>
