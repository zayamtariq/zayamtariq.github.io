<h1>belonging, trolling, and everything in between</h1> 

<p> 
    i've recently come across the realization that any time i don't feel like i belong in a community, my immediate response is to believe that i'm above it. 
    this feeling like not belonging has kind of always existed. i always downplay the importance of identity in my life because i really don't want to be one of those people 
    who complains, but to be extremely cliche, being the only indian kid in a school of white and black kids is really weird. and maybe i didn't consciously ever acknowledge it because 
    i didn't want to seem weak, but a lot of my identity in elementary school was based on being a baljeet kind of character. and this whole being-out-of-place feeling kind of never left me. 
    i learned the only true way to connect with people was to pretend that i was really interested in the words that they were saying even if i wasn't. and it works! but then i don't feel connected to 
    anyone because i'm just always being fake. and so i'm not sure if i belong anywhere, and it's all my fault.

<p>i honestly don't have a good understanding of my identity and how i perceive it. i think i've buried it down a lot. i'll think more about this and update this page later.</p>
