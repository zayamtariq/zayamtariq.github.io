<h1>belonging, trolling, and everything in between</h1> 

<h2>identity</h2> 

<p> 
    i've recently come across the realization that any time i don't feel like i belong in a community, my immediate response is to believe that i'm above it. 
    this feeling like not belonging has kind of always existed. i always downplay the importance of identity in my life because i really don't want to be one of those people 
    who complains, but to be extremely cliche, being the only indian kid in a school of white and black kids is really weird. and maybe i didn't consciously ever acknowledge it because 
    i didn't want to seem weak, but a lot of my identity in elementary school was based on being a baljeet kind of character. and this whole being-out-of-place feeling kind of never left me. 
    i learned the only true way to connect with people was to pretend that i was really interested in the words that they were saying even if i wasn't. and it works! but then i don't feel connected to 
    anyone because i'm just always listening. and so i'm not sure if i belong anywhere, and it's all my fault. 
</p>

<p>i honestly don't have a good understanding of my identity and how i perceive it. i think i've buried it down a lot. i'll think more about this and update this page later.</p>

<h2>iwata</h2>

<p> 
    i remember after president of nintendo, satoru iwata, died, there was a big, heartfelt response on social media regarding his death. i don't think i really cared too much - i had never met the guy and for me, 
    videogames was just a fun thing for me. it wasn't "my escape from society" because i was bullied as a kid or because i came from a bad home or whatever the typical story is. i just thought videogames were cool i think. 
    i certainly did find a comfort in videogames in the sense that i didn't have to perform around videogames in the same way that i performed around people to please them, but this wasn't something i was really conscious of, 
    nor did i understand how devastatingly pathetic it was at the time that i felt i had to perform for other people. regardless, iwata dying was just a typical celebrity death for me. i remember seeing some of the posts honoring his death, 
    and i remember feeling a lot of pressure in my heart resembling the feeling of grief. while i couldn't directly understand what iwata meant to all of these people, the art that these community members had made of iwata helped me perfectly relate
    feelings of loss from MY life to the feelings of loss that they were feeling (by the way, art is amazing for being able to capture unique moments of life and somehow universalize them to a general audience. does this make sense?). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jas4VTS_7HA">
    there was this video that was in tribute of him.</a> i'm not sure what posesses me to do this, but i just felt like fucking with everyone in the comment section of this video. it seems like now my comments are gone, but i said some really heinous crap 
    about iwata. but if i had to pinpoint it, i think it makes perfect sense that i was trolling everyone in this comment section: i didn't belong in the community. at least, not in the way that these people did. i WISH i could relate to the feeling 
    of being devastated over someone's death. i want a place to belong. i want to be sad about iwata's death too! and if i can't, then clearly everyone else is stupid and/or faking it (is how i rationalized it), so i have to rise above them and make fun of them 
    for not being and thinking like me. this is clearly a really toxic way of thinking, and i wouldn't be surprised if a lot of trolls kind of belonged to this "not belonging into making people who do belong feel like crap" pipeline. 
    in a sense, this is the one place where internet trolls do belong, though of course not to generalize internet trolls.

<h2>how do other people do it?</h2> 

<p> 
    the most annoying thing about people who belong is that they have the freedom to be truly and unequivocally themselves. once you belong to a group, 
    you're afforded a free pass to be as weird and downright cringey as you want, because once you belong, you belong. as long as it's with wholesome, genuine, nourishing intent, 
    any weirdness is acceptable! watching a friend group from the outside will always be irritating, because of how comfortably weird they are around each other and exclusively with each other. 
</p>

<p> 
    i'm reminded of that brene brown ted talk that is really popular where she says that the people who have the biggest sense of belonging simply FEEL MORE WORTHY of belonging. that's it. nothing crazy. they just 
    feel more worthy. maybe belonging is just about letting loose, letting whatever comes out of your mouth come out of your mouth, even if it's stupid and cringe. all i know is that people pleasing doesn't work. 
    if you're always walking on egg shells, you'll never belong. people can get really stressful then. 
</p>

<p>
    but also, i think belonging goes beyond more than just you. if you're surrounded by the wrong group, you simply won't belong, at least not to the depth 
    that you could with others. a group of asian dads and a group of white grandmas will include you and make you feel like you belong in varying capacities, depending on who you are. 
    the key, then, is to understand what groups you want to be a part of, and once you decide on that, find people in those groups with some really serious conviction. complaining about not feeling 
    like belonging and then not trying to meet NEW people is really ridiculous and counter-intuitive, and yet i think in our minds we can convince ourselves of some really silly things.

<p> 
    it's not a crime to want to belong, so it's odd that it feels that way. there's no shame in wanting things that make you happy, and yet.
