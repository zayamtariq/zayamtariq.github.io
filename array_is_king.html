<h1>why linked lists are a scam (kinda)</h1>

<p>I remember during my sophomore year of college, I met this guy Clark who was really, really smart with computers. One day, we had a discussion about data structures (because I was currently in the data structures class that my university offered and some upcoming project must have been on my mind). He told me that arrays were, practically speaking, ALWAYS more useful than linked lists, which I thought was kind of interesting. I never followed up and I kinda regret it, because now I know a fact without really knowing why it's true.</p>
<p>Basically, I'm here to remediate that right now.</p>

Ok so I guess here are my notes about arrays.
