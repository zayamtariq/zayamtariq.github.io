<h1>THESE IDEAS CHANGED THIS GUYS LIFE</h1>
<p>and i always wish my life would change so this seemed like a very attractive read to me.</p>
<p>truthfully, i always feel a little shame towards myself for reading stuff like this. like, shouldn't i have my shit together? who am i to think that just from reading an article i will suddenly have my life together? and yet, i always click. i think the human mind is hard to explain sometimes.</p>

<a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/ideas-that-changed-my-life/">the article in question</a>

<h2>so what does this mf say?</h2>
<ul>
    <li> - everyone belongs to a tribe and underestimates how influential the tribe is on their thinking</li>
    <li> - everything's been done before. the scenes change, but the underlying human nature doesn't. </li>
    <li> - you can learn about your own field by studying other fields. </li>
    <li> - you can justify nearly anything when the underlying value is self-interest </li>
    <li> - room for error is underappreciated and misunderstood </li>
    <li> - personal experiences make up 80% of how we think the world works, despite being only .000000000001% of what has actually happened in the world </li>
</ul> 

<p> 
    so this is kind of all the stuff that has resonated with me. what's really interesting to me from this is that third one. it kind of reminds me of this one quote i heard regarding specialization vs. generalization.

    "A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects." - somebody much smarter than me

<p> i don't know. sometimes i struggle to come to terms with this type of thinking. it feels like the world, more and more, kind of values people who are really, really good at one thing. but a fulfilled life comes from understanding all sorts of viewpoints. naturally, i think someone should take the latter path, but it can often feel very anxiety-inducing to not focus on the things that society would tell you to (i.e. getting really, really good at one specific skill so that you can get a really, really good job). 
    but that third point, the idea of being able to understand your own field by going to study other fields, is a really important one to me. i like to think of the world in the perspective of views. i.e. like an actual view from a mountain. 
    there are certain views we can only understand from certain heights, and on certain mountains. the world can feel so small from the bottom, but climb to the top of a mountain and you can understand it in an entirely different light. i think each field can be seen as a mountain. 
    software engineering is a mountain with its own views. journalism is another with its own views. and rising to the top of each mountain reveals things about ourselves and the assumptions we make about the world. and i think these things we learn and gain actually improve us on such a fundamental level, 
    that they then pervade in all aspects of work! therefore, not only SHOULD you generalize, you MUST generalize. at least i think so. this is what ill tell myself from now on.
