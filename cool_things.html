    <li><a href="https://visakanv.substack.com/p/nothing-is-edgier-than-earnestness">"I reminded myself: I would much rather be disappointed from occasionally not getting what I want, than living a small life where I refuse to allow myself to want anything. And honestly, that’s an easier one. What’s harder to talk about are the relationships that I’ve soured, and feel responsible for. I once criticized a friend from a place of earnest “surely you’d want to know if you’re wrong!” posture in 2011 or so, and she never talked to me again. It broke my heart. For years I’d periodically agonize about what I had done wrong. A decade later I think I’ve come around to… anybody can leave at any time for any reason they want, and I respect that. I’d like it if we could actually talk about our conflicts as mature adults, but if for some reason that’s not an option, I respect that too. It’s sad. There’s a lot of sadness in living, and a path of earnestness is a path of grieving. I’m tempted to tie this one up in a joke, maybe involving the phrase “grief-maxxing” somehow, but the truth is that it’s sad. That’s how it goes."</a></li>
